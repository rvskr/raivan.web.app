# Add Firebase to your JavaScript project

Follow this guide to use the FirebaseJavaScript SDK in your web app or as a client for
end-user access, for example, in a Node.js desktop or IoT application.

## **Step 1**: Create a Firebase project and register your app

Before you can add Firebase to your JavaScript app, you need to create a
Firebase project and register your app with that project. When you register your
app with Firebase, you'll get a Firebase configuration object that you'll use to
connect your app with your Firebase project resources.

Visit [Understand Firebase Projects](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more) to learn more
about Firebase projects and best practices for adding apps to projects.

#### **Create a Firebase project**

1. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), click **Add project**.
   - To add Firebase resources to an _existing_ Google Cloud
      project, enter its project name or select it from the dropdown menu.


   - To create a _new_ project, enter a project name. You can also
      optionally edit the project ID displayed below the project name.
2. If prompted, review and accept the [Firebase terms](https://firebase.google.com/terms).

3. Click **Continue**.

4. _(Optional)_ Set up Google Analytics for your project, which
    enables an optimal experience using the following Firebase products:
    [Firebase A/B Testing](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ab-testing),
    [Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging),
    [Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics),
    [In-App Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/in-app-messaging), and
    [Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config)
    (including [Personalization](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/personalization)).


Either select an existing
    [Google Analytics account](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009618)
    or create a new account. If you create a new account, select your
    [Analytics reporting location](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations),
    then accept the data sharing settings and Google Analytics terms for
    your project.


5. Click **Create project** (or **Add Firebase**,
    if you're adding Firebase to an existing Google Cloud project).



Firebase automatically provisions resources for your Firebase project. When
the process completes, you'll be taken to the overview page for your Firebase
project in the Firebase console.

#### **Register your app**

After you have a Firebase project, you can register your web app with that project.

1. In the center of the [Firebase console's project\\
    overview\\
    page](https://console.firebase.google.com/), click the **Web** icon
    (plat\_web)
    to launch the setup workflow.


If you've already added an app to your Firebase project, click **Add app** to
    display the platform options.


2. Enter your app's nickname.


    This nickname is an internal, convenience identifier and is only visible to
    you in the Firebase console.

3. Click **Register app**.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to add and initialize the Firebase SDK in your app.

You can also find more detailed instructions for adding, initializing, and using the Firebase
    SDK in the next steps of this getting started page.



If you don't already have a JavaScript project and just want to try out a
Firebase product, you can download one of our [quickstart samples](https://firebase.google.com/docs/samples).

## **Step 2**: Install the SDK and initialize Firebase

This page describes setup instructions for the Firebase JS SDK's modular API,
which uses a [JavaScript Module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
format.

This workflow uses npm and requires module bundlers or JavaScript framework
tooling because the modular API is optimized to work with
[module bundlers](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/module-bundling)
to eliminate unused code (tree-shaking) and decrease SDK size.

1. Install Firebase using npm:




```
npm install firebase
```

2. Initialize Firebase in your app and create a Firebase App object:




```
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';

// TODO: Replace the following with your app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
     //...
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```


A Firebase App is a container-like object that stores common configuration
and shares authentication across Firebase services. After you initialize a
Firebase App object in your code, you can add and start using Firebase
services.

If your app includes dynamic features based on server-side rendering (SSR),
you'll need to take some additional steps to ensure that your configuration
persists across server rendering and client rendering passes. In
your server logic, implement the
[`FirebaseServerApp`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/app.firebaseserverapp) interface to
optimize your app's
[session management with service workers](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/service-worker-sessions#server_side_changes).


## **Step 3**: Access Firebase in your app

Firebase services (like Cloud Firestore, Authentication, Realtime Database,
Remote Config, and more) are available to import within individual
sub-packages.

The example below shows how you could use the Cloud Firestore Lite SDK to retrieve
a list of data.

```
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFirestore, collection, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore/lite';
// Follow this pattern to import other Firebase services
// import { } from 'firebase/<service>';

// TODO: Replace the following with your app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  //...
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore(app);

// Get a list of cities from your database
async function getCities(db) {
  const citiesCol = collection(db, 'cities');
  const citySnapshot = await getDocs(citiesCol);
  const cityList = citySnapshot.docs.map(doc => doc.data());
  return cityList;
}
```

## **Step 4**: Use a module bundler (webpack/Rollup) for size reduction

The Firebase Web SDK is designed to work with module bundlers to remove any
unused code (tree-shaking). We strongly recommend using this approach for
production apps. Tools such as the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli),
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/), or [Create\\
React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) automatically
handle module bundling for libraries installed through npm and imported into
your codebase.

See our guide [Using module bundlers with Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/module-bundling) for more information.

## Available Firebase services for web

Now that you're setup to use Firebase, you can start adding and using any of the
following available Firebase services in your web app.

The following commands show how to import Firebase libraries installed locally
with [`npm`](https://npmjs.com/). For alternative import options, see the
[available libraries documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more#available-libraries).

**1** _Firebase AI Logic was formerly called_
_"Vertex AI in Firebase" with the package_
_`firebase/vertexai`._

## Next steps

**Learn about Firebase:**

- Explore [sample Firebase apps](https://firebase.google.com/docs/samples).

- Get hands-on experience with the
[Firebase Web Codelab](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-nextjs).

- Explore the [open source code in\\
GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk).

- Review the [supported environments](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/environments-js-sdk) for the
FirebaseJavaScript SDK.

- Speed up your development with additional Firebase-maintained open source
libraries, like
[AngularFire](https://firebaseopensource.com/projects/angular/angularfire2/),
[RxFire](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/tree/master/packages/rxfire#rxfire), and
[FirebaseUI for web](https://firebaseopensource.com/projects/firebase/firebaseui-web/).

- Prepare to launch your app:

  - Set up [budget\\
    alerts](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/billing/avoid-surprise-bills#set-up-budget-alert-emails)
    for your project in the Google Cloud console.
  - Monitor the [_Usage and billing_\\
    dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/usage)
    in the Firebase console to get an overall picture of your project's
    usage across multiple Firebase services.

  - Review the [Firebase launch checklist](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/launch-checklist).
